# jRules Framework

## Introduction

JRules is a framework to execute rules or a group of rules before specific call method. The main developments objetive is validate signature methodâ€™s parameters in an easy and simple way, using annotations.

In this first version, jRules is based on spring, for this reason all the annotation's interception happen when the method's calls are through the context. I'm working in other version without spring dependency, using just aspectj.
